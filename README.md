# WearThatHeat

Are you looking for a Swedish based marketplace where you can buy authentic cloths from a great variation of popular brands, WearThatHeat is the place for you. In first sight you see all the new arrived products displayed on the homepage that you can with ease select and take a closer look to then decide if you would like to buy. Besides that, you as a user can browse between all the different clothing in one single tab. To make it easier for users to find the product they are looking for I have implemented several ways to sort products. For the purpose of finding something they know are in stock users can use the searchbar at the top, other sorting methods like price or a specific type of clothing exists aswell. WearThatHeat is even more friendly when it comes to administration, more info regarding that further down.

##  Features Left to Implement:
* News Letter - A cool feature to add would be to make it possible for the users to sign up for a news letter so that they can get updated each time the stock gets a major update.
* FAQ - A FAQ would be good since questions and misundestandings are very common. An FAQ would be a good way to handle them
* Swish - Swish is a Swedish payment system which is relativly easy to implement with API. This makes it very easy for users to pay from their phone. It is a wellknown app used in Sweden and very trustworthy.

## Manual Testing:
* Using - I have used the site, tried every feature multiple times to make sure everything works as it should without problems.

* Friends and Family - I have asked friends and family to try it out aswell and asked for feedback. Functionality wise they found that categories was not displayed properly and that is now fixed.


## Unfixed Bugs:
* Confirmation Emails - Since I used the same version of Django as in the walkthrough (Django > 4) Email functionality donâ€™t seem to be supported. I spent hours trying to migrate/update the version of Django but because that resulted in new errors and problems I left it as an unfixed bug. I also contacted Student Care regarding this and did not get a clear answer on how to handle this. Might be worth mentioning that the code to accomplish this email functionality is there and the emails is getting logged in the terminal while in DEVELOPMENT.

* Validation Error - This error occures because of a duplication of an Id that generates with CrispyForms that I cannot affect
